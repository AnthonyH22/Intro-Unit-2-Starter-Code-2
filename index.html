      <h2>A rare condition known as monkeypox is brought on by infection with the monkeypox virus. The variola virus, which causes smallpox, and the monkeypox virus are both members of the same virus family. Smallpox symptoms are comparable to those of monkeypox, but they are milder, and monkeypox rarely results in death.</h2>
